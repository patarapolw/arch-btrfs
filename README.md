# Arch Linux BTRFS scripts

## Introduction

This is my fork of [Arch-Setup-Script](https://github.com/tommytran732/Arch-Setup-Script), a collection of **scripts** made in order to boostrap a basic **Arch Linux** environment with **automated snapshots** with Snapper, recommended **security** measures, and **encryption** with LUKS.

This fork focuses on editing, in order to create a system that suits your needs. (Feel free to fork and edit the repo; before cloning to the installation media.)

## How does it work?

1. Download an Arch Linux ISO from [here](https://archlinux.org/download/)
2. Flash the ISO onto an [USB Flash Drive](https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/USB_flash_installation_medium).
3. Boot the live environment.
4. Connect to the internet. (You may need to `rfkill unblock wifi`.)
5. `pacman -Syy git && git clone --depth=1 https://github.com/patarapolw/arch-btrfs/`
   - If `pacman` mirrors are dead, run `reflect --latest 5 --sort rate --save /etc/pacman.d/mirrorlist`
6. `cd arch-btrfs/install && ls`
7. Run the `*.sh` one by one, according to your needs.
8. You may have to `git clone` again, after `arch-chroot`.

## Snapper behavior

The partition layout I use allows us to replicate the behavior found in openSUSE ðŸ¦Ž

1. Snapper rollback <number> works! You will no longer need to manually rollback from a live USB like you would with the @ and @home layout suggested in the Arch Wiki.
2. You can boot into a readonly snapshot! `display-manager`, `NetworkManager` and other services will start normally so you can get in and verify that everything works before rolling back.
3. Automatic snapshots on pacman install/update operations
4. Directories such as /boot, /boot/efi, /var/log, /var/crash, /var/tmp, /var/spool, /var/lib/libvirt/images, /var/lib/docker are excluded from the snapshots as they either should be persistent or are just temporary files. /cryptkey is excluded as we do not want the encryption key to be included in the snapshots, which could be sent to another device as a backup.
5. GRUB will boot into the default BTRFS snapshot set by snapper. Like on OpenSUSE, your running system will always be a read-write snapshot in @/.snapshots/X/snapshot. 

## Changes to the original project

1. Separated scripts. Aimed to be editable and customizable.
2. Encryption is optional. Simply skip `./install/*-encrypt.sh`
3. Desktop environment by your choice. I've experiment all of GNOME, KDE, XFCE and LXQt.
4. Added more filesystem support (Since Disk Utility is a GNOME dependency and it supports exFAT, NTFS, F2FS, ReiserFS and UDF, I added support for those out of the box to make the experience a bit better out of the box. Actually, Disk Utility is helpful for KDE too (especially for ISO mounting and managing `/etc/fstab`).)
5.  Post-installation utilities and how-tos.
